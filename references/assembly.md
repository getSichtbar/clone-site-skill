# Assembly: review the team's work, wire it, gate it, close the gap

Step 5. Input: N finished section files plus their `report.md` / `requests.json`. Output: a wired, built,
measured clone and `.clone/CLONE-REPORT.md`. Every number here is a gate. Never claim a gate you did not run.
`cdp:` = `mcp__plugin_chrome-devtools-mcp_chrome-devtools__` throughout.

Preconditions: `run.json.phase == "assemble"`; every section is `done`, `failed`, or `skipped`; the original's
per-section captures exist (`orig-w<width>.webp` for agents, `orig-w<width>.png` for the diff — §4).

## Review order

Cheapest first. Never screenshot what a grep would have caught.

| # | Pass | Browser? | Catches |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Static sweep per section | no | ~40% of defects: token drift, paraphrased copy, forbidden imports, missing file |
| 2 | Drain `requests.json` | no | cross-section conflicts, missing tokens, dependency creep |
| 3 | Wire + build | no | import errors, type errors, wrong export names |
| 4 | Capture the clone | yes | — |
| 5 | Diff + geometry + gates → `VERIFY.md` | yes | everything measurable |
| 6 | Read `report.md`, **only** for sections that failed a gate or flagged a deviation | no | why the agent did what it did |

Reading 20 passing reports is waste. Reading a failing agent's report *before* its geometry table is also
waste — numbers say where to look, the report says why.

## 1. Static sweep

Spawn one `clone-reviewer` per finished wave (no browser, safe to run alongside anything). Give it the wave's
`outFile` list, each `spec.json`, and this table. It returns verdict rows; you fill `run.json.sections[].gates`.

| Check | Command / method | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| File exists, non-trivial | `wc -c <outFile>` | > 200 bytes |
| Export matches `spec.exportName` | `grep -c "export function <Name>"` | ≥ 1, and no `export default` |
| Hardcoded colors | `grep -Eoc '#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}\b\|rgba?\(\|hsla?\(\|oklch\(\|oklab\(' <outFile>` | **0** |
| Arbitrary values | `grep -Eoc '\-\[[0-9.]+(px\|rem\|em\|%)\]' <outFile>` | ≤ **3**, each justified in `report.md` |
| Forbidden imports | every `^import … from '(.+)'` against `spec.dependencies.allowed` | 0 outside the allowlist |
| Text fidelity | normalize both (collapse whitespace, strip markup), Levenshtein ratio vs `content.md` | ≥ **0.995** |
| Asset paths | every `src=` / `url()` appears in `spec.assets[].ref` (a public path — a bare `img/…` relative src is a fail, not a pass) | 100% |
| `"use client"` | present only if `report.md` states why | justified or absent |
| Effects present | for each `spec.effects[]` row, its `prop` appears in the file (`backdrop-blur`/`backdrop-filter`, `mix-blend-*`, `clip-path`, `mask-image`, `filter`/`blur-*`) with the measured `value` | **100%** — no probe and no pixel score reliably catches a missing glass blur or blend mode |
| Form fidelity | for each `spec.form.fields[]`: `type`, `name`, `required`, `autocomplete`, `inputmode`, verbatim `placeholder` present; `appearance` preserved where measured; `::placeholder` styled; every `states[]` row expressed | **100%**, and arbitrary values inside these rows do not count against the ≤3 budget |
| Spec compliance | every `spec` measurement (padding, gap, size, weight, radius, max-width) present as a token utility | no silent omissions |

A section failing only static checks is repaired without a screenshot. Fix trivia yourself — stray
`"use client"`, wrong import path, missing `aria-labelledby` — instead of re-spawning an agent for one line.

## 2. Drain requests

Read every `.clone/sections/*/requests.json`. You own every shared file, so every request is applied centrally
and recorded in `run.json.requests.applied[]` or `.rejected[]`.

| Kind | Action |
|---|---|
| `token` | Verify the value exists in `foundation.json` (`color.palette`, `type.scale`, `space.scale`, `patterns.*`). Measured → add under the §G role vocabulary. Within ΔE < 2 of an existing token → reject, name the existing one. Absent from `foundation.json` → reject as invented. |
| `dependency` | Approve only when no CSS-native equivalent exists (`scroll-snap`, `animation-timeline: view()`, `@starting-style`, `popover`). Default answer is no. Install once yourself. |
| `shared-component` | Requested by ≥2 sections → build it in the shared dir and patch both importers yourself. By 1 → stays local. |
| `global-css` | `@keyframes`, `@property`, `@supports`, custom-property fallbacks → accept into the token/global file. Layout or component rules → reject, they belong in the component. |

Conflicts, resolved by you and never by write-order:

| Conflict | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Same token name, two values | Keep the one matching `foundation.json`. Both real (two distinct measured surfaces) → add both with distinct role names. |
| Two agents hardcoded the same color | Real measured value → add token, patch both. Invented → force the nearest token. |
| Two sections built the same sub-component | Extract to the shared dir, edit both imports. Neither agent does this. |
| Sections overlap in the DOM (segmentation error) | Your call: re-cut the boundary and re-run both, or merge into one section and one file. Never ship duplicated markup. |
| `"use client"` on a static section | Remove it yourself. No re-spawn. |
| Two agents wrote the same asset filename | Impossible by construction — agents never write the asset dir. |

## 3. Wire and build

1. Import every `done` section into `run.json.stack.pageFile` in `sections.json` order (`order` ascending);
   `role: header|footer|sticky-cta` mount in the layout, not the page.
2. Every `skipped` section becomes one comment at its slot: `{/* 05-pricing — skipped by --sections */}`
   (`--static`: `<!-- 05-pricing — skipped by --sections -->`).
3. `--static`: concatenate `sections/<id>.html` into `index.html` in that order, keeping every `data-section`.
4. Build with the command in `run.json.stack` (per-mode commands: `references/stacks.md`). Attribute a build
   failure to a section by the error's file path and repair it **before** any screenshotting — a broken build
   makes every downstream gate meaningless.

### 3.1 Assembly defects you will actually hit

These are what break a fan-out build. Every one is a one-line orchestrator edit — fix it yourself, do not
re-spawn an agent for a renamed attribute. Sweep all of them in one grep pass over the wave's `outFile` list
before you run the build.

| Defect | Detect | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| HTML attributes left in JSX | `grep -nE '\b(class\|for\|stroke-width\|stroke-linecap\|stroke-linejoin\|stroke-dasharray\|clip-path\|clip-rule\|fill-rule\|fill-opacity\|stop-color\|stop-opacity\|xlink:href\|xmlns:xlink)=' <outFile>` | `className`, `htmlFor`, `strokeWidth`, `strokeLinecap`, `strokeLinejoin`, `strokeDasharray`, `clipPath`, `clipRule`, `fillRule`, `fillOpacity`, `stopColor`, `stopOpacity`, `href` (drop the `xlink:` prefix entirely) |
| Unclosed void elements | `grep -nE '<(img\|br\|hr\|input\|source\|path\|circle\|rect\|use\|stop\|line\|polyline\|meta\|link)\b[^>]*[^/]>'` | self-close: `<img … />`. Pasted SVG markup is the usual source. |
| Unescaped text in JSX | build error `Unexpected token`, or `react/no-unescaped-entities`; stray `{` `}` `<` `>` in copy | wrap the run in an expression — `{"Don't guess — measure"}` — and keep the glyph byte-identical to `content.md`. Swapping `’` for `'` to dodge the error is a text-fidelity failure. |
| `"use client"` below line 1 | Next: *the "use client" directive must be put at the top of the file* | move it above every import, or delete it — a section with no hook, no event handler and no browser API does not need it |
| Duplicate export names | `grep -rhoE 'export function [A-Za-z0-9_]+' <sectionsDir> \| sort \| uniq -d` | rename the later collision per the component-naming rule and patch the page import (both are yours) |
| Unused vars / implicit `any` | `tsc --noEmit` under strict mode | delete the dead binding; type the prop. Never widen to `any` and never disable the rule. |
| Missing React `key` in `.map` | console warning on the clone → fails the console gate | `key={item.id ?? i}` on the mapped root element |
| Section renders at ≈0 height | clone manifest `box.h < 8` while the original is hundreds of px | the reveal ships as `opacity:0` with no visible default, or the data array is empty. Content must be visible by default and the reveal enhance it (`motion.json.bySection.<id>.reducedMotion.clonePlan`). |
| One section overflows horizontally | global overflow probe reports `docOverflow: true` at one width, offenders all inside one section | fix that section (a fixed `w-[…]`, a non-wrapping grid, an unclipped absolute child). Never `overflow-x: hidden` on `body` — it hides the bug and kills `position: sticky`. |
| Wrong import path for the mode | build cannot resolve `@/components/…` in `--static` | use the path map in `run.json.stack`; `--static` sections are HTML partials with no imports at all |

## 4. Capture the clone

Serve the built clone (command per mode: `references/stacks.md`), then per gated width:

```
cdp:new_page        { url: "http://localhost:3000/" }          # once; reuse the pageId
cdp:resize_page     { width: <w>, height: 900 }
cdp:emulate         { viewport: "390x844x3,mobile,touch", userAgent: "<the UA used for the original>" }
cdp:evaluate_script { function: "<entire contents of scripts/extract-sections.js>",   # installer
                      filePath: ".clone/raw/sections-clone-<w>.json" }
cdp:evaluate_script { function: "() => window.__clone.sections.all()",                # overwrites with data
                      filePath: ".clone/raw/sections-clone-<w>.json" }
```

Then per section, anchor it and shoot both formats back to back from the same viewport state:

```
cdp:resize_page     { width: <w>, height: <min(section.box.h, 4000)> }
cdp:evaluate_script { function: "() => { document.querySelector('[data-section=\"<id>\"], #<id>')
                        .scrollIntoView({block:'start',behavior:'instant'}); return {y: scrollY}; }" }
cdp:take_screenshot { format: "webp", quality: 88, filePath: ".clone/sections/<id>/clone-w<w>.webp" }
cdp:take_screenshot { format: "png",               filePath: ".clone/sections/<id>/clone-w<w>.png" }
```

- **Same width, same scroll anchor, same device flags, same `resize_page` height as the original's capture** —
  otherwise the diff measures your capture, not the clone. `emulate` resets every omitted option: restate it.
- `.webp` is what a repair agent reads; `.png` is what `visual-diff.mjs` decodes (no WebP decode without npm).
  Sections taller than 4000 px: one `fullPage: true` shot at that width, both sides.
- `orig-w<w>.png` is written back in step 4 alongside the webp (`references/sectioning.md` §7), so it should
  already be on disk. If it is not — a run that predates that pairing, or a section captured through the
  `uid` route — that is an anomaly worth a `run.json.notes` line, and the recovery is: re-navigate to the
  original, prewarm, re-shoot **only the sections you are about to gate**. Never re-measure the whole
  original for a diff, and never substitute `--loose` for the missing PNG.
- Every screenshot and every `evaluate_script` passes `filePath`. No image ever attaches into context.

Then, once per gated width, the page-level pair that feeds §5.3's full-page gate — from the top of the page,
`scrollY === 0`, after a full prewarm scroll so lazy content has painted:

```
cdp:take_screenshot { fullPage: true, format: "webp", quality: 88, filePath: ".clone/screenshots/clone-w<w>-full.webp" }
cdp:take_screenshot { fullPage: true, format: "png",               filePath: ".clone/screenshots/clone-w<w>-full.png" }
```

The original's counterpart (`orig-w<w>-full.webp` / `.png`) was shot in step 4 by `references/sectioning.md` §7.
Under `--profile cheap` neither pair is taken and the full-page gate is reported as `not-run`, never as passed.

## 4b. Capture determinism — do this or the diff measures the clock

On an animated site a naive capture compares two different *moments*, not two designs. Every one
of these cost a real run a wrong conclusion before it was fixed, and the signature is always the
same: **low `aHash` (structure matches) with `worstTile` near 1.0 (one region completely
different)**.

Freeze identically on **both** sides, immediately before every screenshot:

```js
// 1. kill CSS animation and transition
await page.addStyleTag({ content: `*, *::before, *::after {
  animation: none !important; transition: none !important;
  scroll-behavior: auto !important; caret-color: transparent !important; }` });

// 2. pin every video to frame 0 — a <video> frame is a function of elapsed time, so two
//    independent page loads never agree on it. Re-run after EVERY resize: a resize can
//    restart autoplay.
await page.evaluate(async () => { for (const v of document.querySelectorAll('video')) {
  try { v.autoplay = false; v.pause(); if (v.readyState >= 1) v.currentTime = 0; v.pause(); } catch {} } });

// 3. clear JS-written INLINE transforms (scroll parallax). A CSS `animation: none` cannot
//    reach them. Inline only: transforms authored in classes are legitimate layout.
await page.evaluate(() => { for (const el of document.querySelectorAll('[style]')) {
  const st = el.style; if (st.transform || st.translate || st.scale || st.rotate) {
    st.transform = ''; st.translate = ''; st.scale = ''; st.rotate = ''; } } });
```

Measured payoff on one run: freezing the hero video alone took that section from **0.943 → 0.018**.

| trap | symptom | fix |
|---|---|---|
| `<video>` frame differs | whole-section diff ~0.9 with content present on both sides | pin `currentTime = 0`, re-pin per width |
| marquee/slider phase | a band of the section is shifted horizontally | freeze animation; both sides then sit at the same base offset |
| JS inline transforms | one tile at 1.0, `aHash` 2–6 | clear inline transform/translate/scale/rotate |
| consent banner asymmetry | two unrelated sections report **byte-identical** numbers | dismiss on **both** sides (seed the clone's own storage key), and verify the banner in its own pass, undismissed on both |
| a stale dev/prod server | *every* diff ≈ 1.0, page renders unstyled | own the server lifetime, and abort if a known token (e.g. body background) is absent |

**Do not "fix" this by matching scroll position.** Capturing each section with its own top at the
viewport top, tiled, on both sides, is the obvious idea and it was tried: mean diff got **worse**
(0.217 → 0.278 at 1440). Their JS re-applies transforms after each resize, so the extra scrolling
buys nothing and disturbs more than it settles.

## 5. The gate suite

### 5.1 Per section, per gated width — desktop = width ≥ 1024, narrow = width < 1024

| Gate | `run.json` field | Method | PASS | WARN | FAIL |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Pixel diff, desktop | `gates.byWidth.<w>.pixelDiff` | §6 | ≤ **0.025** | 0.025–0.060 | > **0.060** |
| Pixel diff, narrow | same | §6 | ≤ **0.040** | 0.040–0.090 | > **0.090** |
| Perceptual hash | `gates.byWidth.<w>.aHash` | 8×8 gray aHash, Hamming/64 | ≤ **5** | 6–10 | > **10** |
| Worst tile | `gates.byWidth.<w>.worstTile` | 8 cols × 12 rows over the section | ≤ **0.20** | 0.20–0.35 | > 0.35 |
| Horizontal overflow | `gates.byWidth.<w>.overflowOffenders` | `() => window.__clone.responsive.overflow()` (`references/responsive.md`) | **0** | — | ≥ 1 |
| Geometry probes | `gates.geometryPass` / `geometryWorstPx` | §5.2 | ≥ **0.90** and no probe with \|Δy\| > 16px | 0.85–0.90 | < 0.85 |
| Text fidelity | `gates.textFidelity` | §1 | ≥ **0.995** | 0.98–0.995 | < 0.98 |
| Token drift | `gates.hardcodedColors` | §1 grep | **0** | — | ≥ 1 |
| Arbitrary values | `gates.arbitraryValues` | §1 grep | ≤ **3** | 4–8 | > 8 |
| Console | `gates.consoleErrors` | `cdp:list_console_messages {types:["error"]}`, attributable to this section | **0** | — | ≥ 1 |
| Section height | — | `diff.json.sizeDelta.hPct` | ≤ **2%** | 2–5% | > 5% |

`verdict = "pass"` requires every row at PASS; any FAIL → `"fail"`; otherwise `"warn"`. A `warn` does not block
`done` but must appear in `CLONE-REPORT.md` with its numbers.

### 5.2 Geometry probes

Re-run `scripts/extract-sections.js` on the clone (§4) and join `probes[]` **by `name`**, never by selector —
the clone's DOM has different `nth-of-type` paths, and `name` (`root`, `heading`, `body`, `cta`, `media`,
`eyebrow`, `repeat-item`) is the closed vocabulary that makes the join legal.

| Property | Tolerance | Property | Tolerance |
|---|---|---|---|
| `box.y` (section-relative top) | `max(4px, 1.5% of section height)` | `font.letterSpacing` | ≤ **0.01em** |
| `box.h` | `max(4px, 2% of value)` | `color`, `bg` | exact after `rgb()` normalization |
| `box.w` | `max(4px, 1% of value)` | `radius` | ≤ **1px** |
| `font.size` | ≤ **0.5px** | `pad` (each side) | ≤ **2px** |
| `font.weight` | exact | `shadow` | offsets ≤ 1px, alpha Δ ≤ 0.02 |
| `font.lineHeight` | ≤ **1px** | | |

`geometryPass` = passing rows / total rows. Write `.clone/sections/<id>/geometry.md` with fixed columns and the
cause in a trailing comment — this is the file a repair agent reads:

```
probe        prop         original         clone            Δ         tol      verdict
root         box.h        968px            981px            +13px     19px     PASS
heading      box.y        128px            146px            +18px     14px     FAIL  <- padding-block wrong
repeat-item  box.w        365.33px         352px            -13.33px  4px      FAIL  <- gap 32 vs 40
```

### 5.3 Global gates — once, before `phase: "done"`

| Gate | Method | Threshold | `run.json` field |
|---|---|---|---|
| Font files present | every `foundation.fontFamilies[].files` entry exists on disk; every `@font-face` `src` is a local path | **100%** | — |
| No runtime font CDN | `cdp:list_network_requests {resourceTypes:["font","stylesheet"]}` → zero hits on `fonts.googleapis.com`, `fonts.gstatic.com`, `use.typekit.net`, `p.typekit.net` | **0** | — |
| Console clean | `cdp:list_console_messages {types:["error"]}` after a full prewarm scroll | **0** errors, ≤ 2 warnings | `verify.overall.consoleErrors` |
| No 4xx/5xx | `cdp:list_network_requests` → any `status >= 400` | **0** | `verify.overall.http404` |
| Token drift, repo-wide | §1 color grep across sections + shared dirs, excluding the token file and `*.svg` | **0** | `verify.overall.tokenDrift` |
| Overflow sweep | overflow probe at **360, 390, 768, 1024, 1280, 1440, 1920** (`cheap`: gated widths only) | **0** offenders at every width | `verify.overall.overflowBreakpoints` |
| Full-page diff | `visual-diff.mjs .clone/screenshots/orig-w<w>-full.png .clone/screenshots/clone-w<w>-full.png` at the primary width (`standard`), every gated width (`thorough`), not run on `cheap` | mean ≤ **0.030**, no section at FAIL | `verify.overall.diffMean` / `diffWorst` |
| Document height | `\|Δ docHeight\| / original` at the primary width | ≤ **4%** | `verify.overall.docHeightDelta` |
| Build | the build command from `run.json.stack` | exit 0, zero type errors | — |
| Provenance complete | every mirrored file in the project asset dir appears in `.clone/PROVENANCE.md` with url + content-type + bytes + sha256 | **100%** | — |
| Fingerprint diff | §5.4 | ≥ **0.90** of rows in tolerance | — |
| a11y floor (`thorough`) | `cdp:lighthouse_audit {mode:"navigation", device:"desktop"}`, both sides | clone ≥ original − 2 | — |

### 5.4 Fingerprint diff

`foundation.json.fingerprint[]` is the numeric verification contract. Re-run `scripts/extract-foundation.js`
on the clone (`filePath: ".clone/raw/foundation-clone-<w>.json"`), join rows by `(tag, textHead)` — text is
verbatim, so it is a stable key — and compare `fontSizePx`, `fontWeight`, `lineHeightPx`, `resolvedFamily`,
`color`, `bg`, `textWidthPx` with the §5.2 tolerances (`textWidthPx` ≤ 1.5%, the real test of whether the right
font file loaded). A `resolvedFamily` mismatch means fallback rendering: FAIL the font gate, not a geometry warn.

### 5.5 Motion and responsive parity

Static, cheap, and invisible to a pixel diff — which is exactly why it needs its own gate.

| Check | Method | Gate |
|---|---|---|
| Keyframes present | every `motion.json.cssom.keyframes[].name` used by a shipped section exists in the clone's CSSOM | 100% |
| Durations / easings | per `bySection.entrance[]`: clone duration within **±20%**, same easing family | ≥ 90% of entries |
| Reduced motion | `motion.json.reducedMotion.authored == true` → clone has a `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block over those selectors | present |
| Evidence rule | recover missing source evidence; keep the discovered interaction unresolved until measured, never silently drop it | 0 required unsourced behaviors |
| Breakpoints | `responsive.json.breakpointSystem.boundaries` vs the clone's authored media queries; `reorder[]` and `breakpointOnly[]` reproduced at the measured widths | same set, 100% |
| `clamp()` fidelity | sample the clone at each `deltas[].fluid` fit's min and max width | within **1px** |

When the available browser cannot emulate a state, mark it `authored-not-verified`; when it can, test it. Keep accessibility enhancements separate from source parity. Tool limitations are unresolved evidence, never a passed comparison.

### 5.5b Behavioral parity

Read `references/interactions.md` and compare each recorded sequence on the original and clone, including intermediate motion and exit/reset states. Run `scripts/check-interactions.mjs` against `.clone/interactions.json`; it validates evidence coverage, not visual truth. Inspect the actual comparison artifacts. No required interaction may remain merely implemented, untested, or unresolved when claiming fidelity.

Header menus must be opened to validate their centering, backdrop and pointer path. A carousel must cross both wrap boundaries, and autoplay must be observed after interaction. A static resting-state diff and an error-free build cannot substitute for these checks. Keep visual checkpoints aligned before attributing failures to animation phase.

### 5.6 `VERIFY.md`

Rewrite `.clone/VERIFY.md` every verify pass, worst-first, and update
`run.json.verify.{lastRunAt,overall,failing,history}` in the same transition.

```md
# VERIFY — iteration 1 · 2026-07-30T19:04:11Z

```

## 5b. Five ways a gate lies, and what to gate instead

Each of these produced a phantom failure on a real run. The pattern to internalise: **when a
whole class of sections fails identically, suspect the instrument before the code.**

| the lie | why | gate instead |
|---|---|---|
| text fidelity ~0.22 on *every* section | the wanted-strings list was scraped from `content.md` including `selector`/`key`/`role` rows, so CSS paths were being demanded as visible copy | extract only `.text`/`.alt` rows; compare with **all whitespace removed** (`textContent` concatenates adjacent elements with no separator); an **`alt` attribute satisfies an alt string** — it can never appear in `textContent`, so image-only sections otherwise score ~0.02 no matter how correct they are |
| geometry "misses" of 90–200 px | probes matched **first-of-tag independently on each side**; in a frozen marquee "first `img`" is arbitrary | skip a probe when the origin box does not intersect the section root, or when the section holds >3 of that tag; a tag **absent** on the clone is a *structural substitution* (`<summary>` for an Alpine `<button>`), not a misplacement |
| a section 3.6× too tall scoring 0.166 | the differ compares only the **overlapping region**, so height error is invisible | surface `sizeDelta.h` as `dh` and gate it (`|dh| > 4` fails). This is what exposed a missing `margin` that a **0.0000** pixel diff had completely hidden |
| half the residual on text-heavy sections | clips are rounded independently on each side, so a section lands on a different sub-pixel row and every glyph anti-aliases differently | search `dy ∈ {-1,0,+1}`, report `pixelDiffAligned`, gate on that, keep the strict value alongside |
| `null` failing a gate that never ran | `null < 0.98` coerces to `0 < 0.98` | guard explicitly: a section with no comparable strings has no text gate |

Two of those changes make the suite **stricter**, not looser — height gating and the alignment
search — and the height gate is the one that found a real defect. If a metric change only ever
turns failures into passes, be suspicious of it.

## 6. Running the diff

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/clone-site/scripts/visual-diff.mjs \
  .clone/sections/06-testimonials/orig-w1440.png \
  .clone/sections/06-testimonials/clone-w1440.png \
  .clone/sections/06-testimonials/diff.json \
  --threshold 12 --cols 8 --rows 12 --out .clone/sections/06-testimonials/diff-w1440.png
```

`--threshold` = per-channel delta (12/255) that counts a pixel as different · `--cols`/`--rows` = heat grid ·
`--gate R` = exit 1 when `pixelDiff > R`, the cheapest way to branch in Bash · `--json` = report to stdout ·
`--out` = red-on-gray diff map. Both images are 2× box-downscaled first, which is what makes the score
insensitive to antialiasing and subpixel text.

Read from `diff.json`: `pixelDiff`, `aHash`, `worstTile`, `worstTileBox`, `worstTiles[0..4]` (top five regions,
in **original** pixel coordinates), `sizeDelta`. Never re-print `tiles[]` into context — 96 numbers a repair
agent can read from disk. `worstTiles` is the point of the exercise: "18% mismatch at x 480–660, y 320–400"
tells a repair agent where to look; a scalar tells it nothing. Paste those boxes into the repair prompt verbatim.
A size mismatch is a finding, not a nuisance: the score covers the overlapping region, `sizeDelta.hPct` is
reported separately, and neither image is ever rescaled to match the other.

Degradation path, in order: (a) inputs must be PNG — re-shoot with `format:"png"` if you only have WebP;
(b) `--loose` returns a byte/size heuristic marked `degraded: true`, usable as a smoke test and never as a
fidelity number; (c) the in-browser alternative — with both images reachable over the clone's own dev server
(same origin, no canvas taint), `cdp:evaluate_script` can `createImageBitmap` → `OffscreenCanvas` →
`getImageData` and compute the identical fields; it reads WebP but emits no `worstTiles`. Record any use of
(b) or (c) in `run.json.notes`.

## 7. The bounded repair loop

```
K    = run.json.budget.repairMax           # set per profile in references/scaling.md
Amax = run.json.budget.sectionAttemptsMax  # same source
iter = run.json.budget.repairUsed
loop:
  failing = sections where gates.verdict == "fail" OR assigned required interactions are not verified
  if failing empty:                        break   # then evaluate all global + behavioral gates
  if iter >= K:                            break   # budget exhausted
  if iter >= 1 and (prevDiffMean - diffMean) < 0.005
     and no gate flipped to pass:          break   # plateau — stop burning tokens
  if one failure signature covers >= 40% of failing:          # systemic
      fix it yourself in the orchestrator-owned file (tokens, container width, base color,
      type scale, layout shell). Do NOT spawn repair agents. Re-verify all sections.
  else:
      for each failing section with attempts < Amax: state = "needs-repair";
      spawn one clone-section agent each, min(len(failing), maxParallel) at a time
  iter++; repairUsed = iter; re-verify only what you touched; continue
```

Repair prompt = the section's original `PROMPT.md` plus the repair addendum defined in
`references/agent-brief.md`, carrying the failing gate values with their thresholds, the `worstTiles` boxes,
`geometry.md`, `diff.json`, `clone-w<w>.webp`, `orig-w<w>.webp`, and the instruction to fix **only** the failing
measurements — churn on passing parts regresses a good score.

Systemic signatures to recognize before spawning anything: every `box.w` short by the same amount (container
max-width), every `box.y` drifting cumulatively (section padding scale), every heading 2px off (type scale or
`line-height` rounding), every background subtly wrong (surface token), narrow widths failing while desktop
passes (breakpoint boundary). One edit fixes 20 sections; 20 agents fix it 20 inconsistent ways.

Plateau is measured on `verify.overall.diffMean` across iterations and recorded in `verify.history[]`: an
absolute improvement below **0.005** with no gate flipping to pass means the remaining error is not the kind
another pixel-focused agent turn removes. Missing behavior still needs its own measurement/implementation work; do not infer behavioral completion from visual plateau. Stop there even if `iter < K`.

When a section will not converge — `attempts == Amax`, or an iteration that improved its own mean diff by less
than 0.005 — stop. Set `state: "failed"`, keep the best version on disk, write its row into `UNRESOLVED.md`,
move on. A clone at
`diffMean 0.034` with three documented gaps beats one claimed done at 0.034 with the gaps hidden.

## 8. `.clone/CLONE-REPORT.md`

Write once, at the end, from `run.json` and the current interaction ledger — never from memory.

Use `verify.outcome: verified` only if all required visual and behavioral gates pass. Use `incomplete` for failed or missing required checks even if the run ends at its budget; use `scoped` only for an explicitly limited user deliverable whose requested checks pass. Record verified/total interactions and unresolved IDs in `verify.interactionCoverage`. An explicit exclusion must cite the user scope instruction. If incomplete, say so in the first sentence of the final answer, with the most material gaps; do not hide that status only in an ignored report file.

```md
# Clone report — <title> (<finalUrl>)

## Not reproduced, and why
| Thing | Why | What shipped instead |
|---|---|---|
| Hero WebGL canvas | shader source not recoverable from the page | static poster PNG at the measured box |
| `:active` press states | not observable through this MCP | authored from CSSOM rules, `authored-not-verified` |
| Signup form submission | `spec.form.actionPolicy: "inert"` — a mirrored `action` would post a visitor's data to the original's owner | markup, labels and every state reproduced; `action` omitted and submit prevented. Measured endpoint recorded in the spec |

## Manual follow-ups
1. `components/sections/Testimonials.tsx` — card gap 40 vs measured 32 at ≥1024. One-line fix.
2. Capture and reproduce the unresolved navigation backdrop and reverse carousel wrap, then rerun their original/clone sequences. These gaps keep this delivery incomplete regardless of profile.

## Note
The mirror reproduces third-party text, marks, and imagery byte-for-byte; swapping or keeping them before you
publish is your call. Every mirrored file is listed in `.clone/PROVENANCE.md` with its source URL,
content-type, byte count, and sha256.
```

`.clone/UNRESOLVED.md` — written only when gates still fail after the budget. One row per residual gap: the
measured delta, the probable cause, the one-line manual fix.

<!-- SPEC-GAP: §C pins captures as orig/clone-w<w>.webp but §E6 requires visual-diff.mjs to take PNG (no WebP
     decode without npm deps), so this file adds a PNG copy of the same capture — orig/clone-w<w>.png, shot
     back-to-back with the webp — and dumps clone-side extractor output to
     .clone/raw/{sections,foundation}-clone-<w>.json (nearest pinned convention to foundation-dark.json).
     references/sectioning.md §7 now shoots the orig PNG back-to-back with the webp as well, so §4's re-shoot
     paragraph is a genuine fallback rather than the default path. -->
