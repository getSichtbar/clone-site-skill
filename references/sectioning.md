# Sectioning — cutting the page into clone-able units

Shorthand in this file: `cdp:` = `mcp__plugin_chrome-devtools-mcp_chrome-devtools__`.

Output: `.clone/sections.json` (`clone-site/sections@1`) for the entry page, `.clone/pages/<pageId>/sections.json`
per extra page, two captures per section per width, and the wave plan in `run.json.sections[]`. The per-section
agent contract is built from these in `references/agent-brief.md`.

## 1. Prewarm — never segment a cold page

Lazy sections, IntersectionObserver reveals and `loading=lazy` images make a cold DOM under-report document
height by 30–60%. Prewarm first, always, at the primary width.

Read `scripts/extract-sections.js` with `Read` and pass its **entire contents** as the `function` argument to
`mcp__plugin_chrome-devtools-mcp_chrome-devtools__evaluate_script`, with `filePath` set to the run-directory
target for that pass (`.clone/raw/install-sections.json`). Never inline the payload into this reference; never
call it without `filePath`. Re-install after **any** `navigate_page` (including `reload`); `resize_page` and
`emulate` keep page state.

| Step | Call | Check |
|---|---|---|
| install | the sentence above | `{ok:true, installed:[…]}` |
| prewarm | `cdp:evaluate_script {function:"() => window.__clone.sections.prewarm()", filePath:".clone/raw/prewarm-1440.json"}` | `imagesDecoded ≥ images·0.9` |
| quiescence | `cdp:list_network_requests {resourceTypes:["image","font","stylesheet"], pageSize:200}` | nothing pending |
| segment | `cdp:evaluate_script {function:"() => window.__clone.sections.all()", filePath:".clone/raw/sections-1440.json"}` | the manifest |

`prewarm()` is `async`; `evaluate_script` awaits it. `docHeight` under 1.5 viewports on a marketing page means
reveals are still gating content — fix that via `references/troubleshooting.md` before trusting a single box.

### Single-section selection

`--section` resolves a real DOM boundary before assets are mirrored. It is intentionally separate from `--sections`,
which is a page-build filter applied only after the complete page manifest exists. A scoped run has one manifest entry,
one output component, and no unselected placeholders.

1. For `css:<selector>`, call `scope()` directly. It rejects invalid selectors, hidden/zero-area targets, and every
   selector that resolves to anything other than one element:

   ```
   cdp:evaluate_script {function:"() => window.__clone.sections.scope(\"#pricing\",{idOverride:\"03-pricing\"})",
                        filePath:".clone/raw/section-scope-1440.json"}
   ```

2. For `id:`, `role:`, or a bare label/slug, call `all()` once at the primary width and resolve against its `id`,
   `role`, and normalized `label`. The match must be exactly one. On zero/multiple matches write
   `.clone/SELECTION.md` with each `{id,label,role,selector}` candidate and ask for an explicit `css:` or `id:` value.
   Never choose by document order.
3. Re-call `scope()` using that resolved selector and preserve the source id/label/role with `idOverride`,
   `labelOverride`, and `roleOverride`. Its `scope.context[]` records painted/padded/positioned ancestors and
   `scope.dependencies[]` records overlay triggers/panels that cross the root boundary; copy both to
   `.clone/SELECTION.md` and `run.json.scope`. Context is evidence for the preview wrapper, not a license to copy
   ancestor content. Cross-boundary dependencies are excluded from scoped interaction parity. Preserve the resolved
   entry's `extraSelectors[]` in the `scope()` call: sliver siblings belong to the selected component and are never
   dropped merely because their root is not nested under the main selector.
4. Then call `prewarm(<resolved selector>,{extraSelectors:<resolved extra selectors>})`. This scrolls every selected
   member into view, promotes/decodes their descendant images, and returns `scoped:true`. Use full-page `prewarm()`
   only when selector resolution required the full manifest or a section-level reveal will not fire from targeted
   scrolling.

For a direct `css:` target, this targeted call replaces the full-page prewarm in the table above. For `id:`, `role:`,
or label/slug selection, the temporary manifest needs the normal full prewarm first; do not infer a full-page manifest
from a cold DOM.

Scoped root selection after the original full prewarm is still valid, but it is wasted work. Do it before the network
census so only selected runtime assets are shipped. The normal foundation/responsive passes remain necessary because a
section inherits page tokens and media/container rules.

For a scoped entry with `extraSelectors[]`, build `content.md` by extracting each selector in visual document order and
retaining the source selector on every row. Capture the same visual union with
`capture(<selector>,{extraSelectors:<entry.extraSelectors>,hideFixed:true})`; it aligns to the top-most member and
returns a union `needsHeight`. Persist that union as `run.json.scope.captureBox[width]`; it, not the primary root's
`section.box[width].h`, is the required capture height on both original and clone. This keeps sliver content,
screenshots, and asset attribution in one component contract.

## 2. The boundary score

`all()` walks the content root's children, scores each candidate on six independent signals, descends into
anything scoring under `KEEP`, then merges slivers into the previous keeper.

| Signal | Weight | Why it is evidence |
|---|---|---|
| full-bleed width (`w ≥ 0.98·VW`) | **2.0** (1.0 at ≥ 0.70·VW) | sections span the page; inner content does not |
| vertical extent `h/VH` | **1.5** ≥0.9 · **1.0** ≥0.3 · **0.4** ≥0.12 | a section is a screenful of scroll |
| background/border/text-color change vs previous sibling | **1.5** | the strongest human cue for "new section" |
| semantic tag (`section header footer main article aside nav form`) | **1.5** | free ground truth when the author bothered |
| heading inside (`h1..h3`, `[role=heading]`) | **1.0** | sections announce themselves |
| name hint in `id`/`class`/`data-section`/`aria-label` | **0.75** | `class="hero"` is not a coincidence |
| ≥2 element children | **0.25** | tiebreak against wrappers around a single node |

- **Descend** (depth < 3) when `score < KEEP` **and** ≥2 children **and** `h > 0.6·VH`: a low score on a tall node
  means the sections are one level deeper, not that there are none. **Split** a keeper with `h > 3.5·VH` holding
  ≥2 `h1..h3` the same way — with no coverage test, which is trap (c).
- **Keep** everything else whatever its score: a node that cannot be descended into is emitted. `KEEP` gates
  descent and sliver-merging, not admission.
- **Merge** a sub-`KEEP` node with `h < SLIVER·VH` (default 0.15) and no heading into the previous section as an
  `extraSelectors[]` entry — dividers, logo strips, spacer bands. Never into chrome (`header`/`footer`/`nav`/fixed),
  never a fixed/sticky node itself. Anything containing a heading is never a sliver, which is why duplicate overlay
  headings survive (trap (d)).
- Candidates are ordered by **document position** — `getBoundingClientRect().top` ascending, not DOM order — so an
  absolutely-positioned block lands where the reader sees it.
- Scroll root resolves first: `<html>`, else the largest genuinely-scrolling `overflow-y:auto|scroll` container
  (Lenis / Locomotive / ScrollSmoother hijack). Every `box` is **scroll-root-relative**; `scrollRoot` records which.
  Content root then unwraps up to 6 single-child shells (`#__next > div > div`) so scoring starts at the real
  section list — trap (a) is when that is not enough.

## 3. Retune, and what `KEEP` actually is

The knob SKILL.md calls `KEEP` is the payload's `keep` option — `sections.all({keep, sliver})`, echoed back as
`sections.json.keepThreshold`. Default `3.0`. Per-profile values (`cheap` 3.6 · `standard` 3.0 · `thorough` 2.6)
live in `references/scaling.md`.

Be honest about direction: `keep` is the score a node must reach to be **accepted instead of descended into**, so
raising it does two opposite things — more descent into low-scoring tall blocks (**more**, smaller sections) and
more sliver merging (**fewer**, bigger sections). On a page with semantic tags and headings almost nothing scores
under 3.6, so only the merge moves and "3.6 → fewer, bigger" holds; on div soup, raising `keep` cuts deeper. Never
predict the count — read `stats.kept` / `stats.retunes` from the dump after each pass. `sliver` is the
one-directional dial: raise it to 0.22 for reliably fewer, bigger sections.

`all()` auto-retunes up to twice, **only when `keep` is omitted**:

| Observed | Payload does | Read it as |
|---|---|---|
| `kept < 4` | `keep` → 2.4, then 1.8 | prewarm failed, or one giant node (traps a–c) — check those before accepting |
| `kept > 30` | `keep` → 3.6, then 4.2, `sliver` → 0.22 | it is cutting inside sections |
| `4 ≤ kept ≤ 30` | accept | a marketing page is 6–24 |

`cheap` and `thorough` pass `keep` explicitly and therefore get **no** auto-retune; you own the loop:

```
cdp:evaluate_script {function:"() => window.__clone.sections.all({keep:3.6,sliver:0.22})",
                     filePath:".clone/raw/sections-1440.json"}
```

`args` carries element uids only, so option literals are interpolated into the `function` source; there is no JSON
channel. Re-cut instead of re-tuning when a `box.h` exceeds 40% of `docHeight`, when two adjacent sections share a
`contentHash`, or when a `box.w` is under half the viewport (inner content that scored on background change alone).

## 4. Four traps, each of which silently yields one giant section or drops content

Run this audit once, right after the first `all()`; it reads the element cache `all()` leaves on
`window.__clone.state.sectionEls`, so same page state, no re-walk:

```
cdp:evaluate_script {filePath:".clone/raw/section-audit-1440.json", function:
"() => { const U = window.__clone.util, E = window.__clone.state.sectionEls || [], R = Math.round, VH = innerHeight;
  const b = (e) => e.getBoundingClientRect();
  const contents = [...document.querySelectorAll('body *')].filter((e) => getComputedStyle(e).display === 'contents')
    .slice(0, 40).map((e) => ({ sel: U.cssPath(e), tag: e.tagName, kids: e.children.length }));
  const audit = E.map((s) => { const r = b(s.el), k = [...s.el.children].filter((c) => b(c).height > 8);
    const cover = r.height ? k.reduce((n, c) => n + b(c).height, 0) / r.height : 0;
    const st = [...s.el.querySelectorAll('*')].filter((c) => getComputedStyle(c).position === 'sticky');
    return { id: s.id, h: R(r.height), vh: +(r.height / VH).toFixed(2), coverage: +cover.toFixed(2), kids: k.length,
      sticky: st.length, stickyTallest: st.length ? R(Math.max(...st.map((x) => b(x).height))) : 0,
      pinned: r.height > VH * 2 && cover < 0.8 && st.length > 0 }; });
  const dupes = [];
  for (const a of E) for (const c of E) { if (a === c) continue; const ra = b(a.el), rc = b(c.el);
    if (!rc.width || !rc.height || ra.width * ra.height <= rc.width * rc.height) continue;
    const ox = Math.max(0, Math.min(ra.right, rc.right) - Math.max(ra.left, rc.left));
    const oy = Math.max(0, Math.min(ra.bottom, rc.bottom) - Math.max(ra.top, rc.top));
    if (ox * oy < rc.width * rc.height * 0.9) continue; const t = U.nlow(c.el.innerText);
    dupes.push({ inner: c.id, outer: a.id, domContained: a.el.contains(c.el),
      textSubset: !!t && U.nlow(a.el.innerText).indexOf(t) >= 0 }); }
  return { docHeight: R(document.documentElement.scrollHeight), contents: contents, audit: audit, dupes: dupes,
    sumSectionH: E.reduce((n, s) => n + R(b(s.el).height), 0) }; }"}
```

**(a) No `<main>` and no `<section>` anywhere.** Framer, Webflow and hand-rolled Next output nest everything in
`<div>`s and render headings as `<div class="framer-text">`, so the semantic-tag (1.5) and heading (1.0) signals go
to zero, the monster-split test (≥2 `h1..h3`) never fires, and the page returns as one candidate. Symptoms:
`kept ≤ 2`, one section with `h ≥ 0.6·docHeight`, or `contentRoot` still `body`. Do **not** walk `body.children`
yourself. The real content root is the deepest node with `scrollHeight ≥ 0.9·docHeight` and ≥3 visible children;
compare it to the manifest's `contentRoot`, then force descent by raising `keep` just past the giant's own recorded
`score` (`{keep: <score> + 0.1}`) — one level per pass, depth capped at 3 below the content root, re-reading
`stats.kept` each pass. If the giant has <2 children the payload cannot descend at all (a single-child chain deeper
than the 6-shell unwrap): flatten those wrappers with the `replaceWith` call below, then re-run `all()`.

**(b) `display: contents` wrappers.** Layout-transparent by design, so `getBoundingClientRect()` is `0×0` while
children lay out normally. The payload's floor (`h < 24 || w < 40`) skips such a node **and never descends into
it**, so its whole subtree disappears from the manifest. Symptom: `contents[]` non-empty with
`sumSectionH < 0.8 × docHeight`, or `kept` 0–1 when the wrapper sits high. Fix by unwrapping — replacing a
`display:contents` element with its children is layout-neutral, that is what the value means:

```
cdp:evaluate_script {filePath:".clone/raw/unwrap-contents.json", function:
"() => { const h0 = document.documentElement.scrollHeight, out = [];
  for (const e of [...document.querySelectorAll('body *')].filter((x) => getComputedStyle(x).display === 'contents'))
    { out.push(window.__clone.util.cssPath(e)); e.replaceWith(...e.childNodes); }
  return { unwrapped: out, before: h0, after: document.documentElement.scrollHeight }; }"}
```

Guards: run it after Step 2's measurement passes and before `all()` — it mutates the DOM, so selectors recorded
earlier go stale and `--refresh`/`--resume` must redo it. If `after` differs from `before` by >1%, the page's CSS was
matching those wrappers as children: `cdp:navigate_page {type:"reload"}`, re-install, accept the coarser cut, and
add a `warnings[]` row naming the selectors.

**(c) A scroll-pinned section** — a very tall track (5–10 viewports) wrapping a short `position:sticky` stage, where
scroll drives the stage's contents. The monster-split fires on height plus two headings with **no coverage test**,
so it descends and returns the sticky stage plus a pile of spacer divs: the effect is destroyed and most of the page
height vanishes. Only split a tall block when its children's summed height actually covers it — `coverage ≥ 0.8`.

| Audit row | Verdict | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `vh ≥ 3.5`, `coverage ≥ 0.8` | genuine tall stack | the split is correct |
| `vh ≥ 2`, `coverage < 0.8`, `sticky ≥ 1` (`pinned:true`) | scroll-pinned track | keep whole. If `all()` split it, restore the parent as the section, move fragment selectors into `extraSelectors[]`, re-probe with `sections.probe()`, add `warnings:["pinned:<id> re-merged"]` |
| `vh ≥ 2`, `coverage < 0.8`, `sticky` = 0 | absolutely-positioned layout | keep whole; take boxes from the audit, never from summing children |

A pinned section is a one-agent, `model: opus` job whose brief carries the track height, `stickyTallest`, and the
`scrollLinked` slice from `motion.json` (rebuild recipes: `references/motion.md`). Never let the track height come
from a screenshot.

**(d) A duplicate heading positioned absolutely over a section as a SIBLING.** Page builders do this constantly.
`Node.contains()` misses it, it holds a heading so it is never sliver-merged, and you ship the H1 twice. Use
geometry: a `dupes[]` entry with ≥90% of the inner box inside the outer box and `textSubset:true` is a duplicate —
drop `inner`, append its selector to the outer section's `extraSelectors[]`; `domContained:true` rows are the same
thing one level down, same treatment. Never merge two overlapping candidates whose text differs: that is a real
overlay and it keeps its own entry.

## 5. Roles, chrome, overlays

`role` is a closed vocabulary: `header` `footer` `nav` `section` `sticky-cta` `overlay`.

| Detected as | Rule in the payload | What the pipeline does |
|---|---|---|
| `header` | `<header>`, or fixed/sticky with `top ≤ 8` + ≥2 links + `h < 0.3·VH`, or first block with ≥2 links + `h < 0.25·VH` | `shared:true`, built once, mounted by the layout not the page. `sticky` carries the exact `position` so offset behaviour survives. |
| `footer` | `<footer>`, or last block with ≥4 links | `shared:true`, layout-mounted |
| `nav` | `<nav>` outside header/footer | own section unless its `contentHash` matches the header's |
| `sticky-cta` | `position:fixed`, `z-index ≥ 40`, `h < 0.5·VH`, not at the top | `shared:true`, layout-mounted, excluded from body flow so it cannot double-render |
| `overlay` | `[role=dialog]`, `[aria-modal=true]`, `<dialog>` | never a body section; listed in `overlays[]` including `display:none` ones, with `open`, `zIndex`, guessed `triggerSelector` |
| `section` | everything else | one `clone-section` agent, one file |

Overlay policy: on `cheap`/`standard` only `open:true` overlays get a section, the rest ship closed with the measured
decl. On `--thorough` open each for a second pass — `cdp:take_snapshot {filePath:".clone/raw/snapshot-overlays.txt"}`
for the trigger uid, `cdp:click {uid}`, re-run `all()`, `cdp:press_key {key:"Escape"}`. A cookie banner is an overlay
to dismiss before **any** capture, never a section.

## 6. Repeated grids, carousels, forms

| Field | Detection | What the brief says (filled in `references/agent-brief.md`) |
|---|---|---|
| `repeat` | a parent with ≥3 children where ≥80% share `tag + first 3 classes + child count`; carries `count`, `containerSelector`, `itemSelector`, `columns` (distinct rounded `left`s), `gap`, `display`, `itemHash` | one local sub-component + a data array. 12 cards = 1 card + 12 data objects, never 12 literals. |
| `carousel` | library class/attr (`swiper slick embla keen-slider flickity glide splide owl-carousel tns- marquee`), `aria-roledescription="carousel"`, or `scrollWidth > clientWidth+24` with `overflow-x` set and ≥3 children | rebuild as a CSS `scroll-snap` track first. A JS carousel library is a `requests.json` entry, never an agent-side install. |
| `form` | `counts.forms > 0` (the payload counts `form,input,textarea,select` per section). Fill it from the DOM: per field `type`, `name`, `required`, `autocomplete`, `inputmode`, verbatim `placeholder`, label text and whether the label is visible, the resting box, and the computed `appearance`; plus every `interactive[].state` row from `motion.json` whose selector is inside the form | §5a — field attributes are content, `appearance:none` is preserved with its affordance re-authored, `::placeholder` styled explicitly, and every captured state ships including the `authored-not-verified` ones. Escalates the section to `model: opus`. |
| `repeat-item` probe | first item of the winning group | per-card geometry that verification re-measures |

A section with `repeat.count ≥ 3` also gets `content()` rows prefixed `item[<i>].` — that prefix is what keeps card
3's body on card 3.

## 7. Per-section captures

Never crop a full-page PNG: you lose resolution and gain off-by-one bands. Resize the viewport to the section and
shoot it, per section, at the current width:

```
cdp:evaluate_script {function:"() => window.__clone.sections.capture(\"#features\",{hideFixed:true})",
                     filePath:".clone/raw/capture-03-features.json"}
cdp:resize_page     {width:1440, height:<min(needsHeight, 4000)>}
cdp:evaluate_script {function:"() => window.__clone.sections.capture(\"#features\",{hideFixed:true})",
                     filePath:".clone/raw/capture-03-features.json"}      # layout moved; re-align
cdp:take_screenshot {filePath:".clone/sections/03-features/orig-w1440.webp", format:"webp", quality:88}
cdp:take_screenshot {filePath:".clone/sections/03-features/orig-w1440.png",  format:"png"}
cdp:evaluate_script {function:"() => window.__clone.sections.restore()", filePath:".clone/raw/restore.json"}
```

**Both formats, back to back, before `restore()`.** `.webp` at quality 88 is what the section agent and any repair
agent read; `.png` is the only thing `visual-diff.mjs` can decode (node built-ins, no WebP decoder). Shooting the
PNG later is not an option — it would mean re-navigating to the original and re-prewarming it during the verify
phase, when the browser is pointed at `localhost`, which is exactly the "never re-measure the original" rule this
pipeline is built on. Two `take_screenshot` calls from one identical viewport/scroll state, every section, every
gated width. The clone side does the same in `references/assembly.md` §4.

**Page level, once per gated width, before the per-section loop** (skip under `--profile cheap` or `--section`, where
the full-page diff gate does not run). Same both-formats rule, and the same reason it cannot wait:

```
cdp:take_screenshot {fullPage:true, format:"webp", quality:88, filePath:".clone/screenshots/orig-w1440-full.webp"}
cdp:take_screenshot {fullPage:true, format:"png",              filePath:".clone/screenshots/orig-w1440-full.png"}
```

`fullPage` is incompatible with `uid`. Pages past roughly 16000 px come back clipped — that is what the stitched
`.clone/screenshots/orig-w<w>-tile-<NN>.webp` set in `references/scaling.md` exists for; record the fallback in
`run.json.notes`. `references/assembly.md` §5.3 diffs `orig-w<w>-full.png` against `clone-w<w>-full.png`.

`capture()` hides every other fixed/sticky box, pauses animations, forces instant scrolling, aligns the section top
to the viewport top, and returns `{box, needsHeight, clipped, tall, atTop, hiddenCount}`. Pass `{hideFixed:false}`
when the section **is** the chrome, `{offset:<headerHeight>}` when you want the sticky header in frame. Always
`restore()` before the next section — hidden chrome and the paused-animation stylesheet are global, and skipping it
smears a band across every later shot. `atTop:false` on the second `capture()` means the container fought you
(hijack, snap, focus trap): shoot anyway, record the delta, read the scroll-hijack row in
`references/troubleshooting.md`. Tall sections (`tall:true`, `needsHeight > 4000`), including every pinned track from
trap (c): resize to `1440×3600` and shoot bands via `capture("#sel",{offset:-3600*k})` for `k = 0,1,2` into
`.clone/sections/<id>/orig-w1440-tile-<NN>.webp` **and `-tile-<NN>.png`** (same pairing, same reason), capped at 3
tiles plus a `warnings[]` row.

Cheaper route where it applies: `cdp:take_snapshot {filePath:".clone/raw/snapshot-<label>.txt"}`, grep the landmark's
uid, then `cdp:take_screenshot {uid, filePath:…, format:"webp", quality:88}` followed by the `format:"png"` sibling
from the same uid. Real limits — only a11y-tree nodes have
uids (a bare `<div>` has none), `uid` is incompatible with `fullPage`, sticky chrome is still painted, and a very
tall element comes back clipped. Use it for `header`/`footer`/`nav`, confirm the file is >5 KB, else fall back.

Width order: capture every section at the primary width, then switch viewport **once** — `cdp:emulate
{viewport:"390x844x3,mobile,touch"}` → re-run `all()` (mobile reorders sections, it does not remove them) → capture
each to `orig-w390.webp` + `orig-w390.png` → restore desktop explicitly with `cdp:emulate {viewport:"1440x900x1"}` plus
`cdp:resize_page {width:1440,height:900}`. Never interleave widths: viewport changes are the expensive call.

For a scoped run, call `scope()` again at each width with the recorded source selector, primary id override, and
recorded `extraSelectors`. Each selector must resolve once at every gated width. A missing narrow-only root is a real responsive finding: preserve
the measured `display:none` rule if that is what the origin does, otherwise stop and record `scope-selector-missing`
in `UNRESOLVED.md`; do not substitute a sibling based on label text.

## 8. Merging widths into `sections.json`

`all()` returns one width's truth, keyed by integer width as a string. The orchestrator merges:

1. The **primary width** manifest is the skeleton — it owns `id`, `order`, `role`, `label`, `selector`, `probes`,
   `contentHash`, `structureHash`.
2. For each other width, match by `contentHash`, else `structureHash`, else `order`; merge only the width-keyed maps
   (`box`, `background`, `layout`, `docHeight`) and set `widths`. Unmatched secondary sections become
   `warnings:["w390: unmatched <selector>"]` — a breakpoint-only element, owned by `references/responsive.md`.
3. Fill what the page cannot know: `page.id`, `shared`/`sharedKey`/`dedupOf` after dedup (§9), `keepThreshold` from
   the accepted pass, and the §4 trap corrections.
4. Write `.clone/sections.json`; extra pages to `.clone/pages/<pageId>/sections.json`, identical schema. Never `Read`
   the merged file whole afterwards — `Grep`/`jq` the field.

In a scoped run, this merge contains exactly one primary entry. Secondary widths re-run `scope()` against the persisted
selector rather than `all()`; merge their width-keyed maps directly into that entry. This avoids an unrelated section
claiming the same label after a responsive reorder.

Ids are stable for the run's life: `<NN>-<slug>`, zero-padded document order at the primary width, deduped with a
numeric suffix. Never renumber after `run.json` is written, including on `--resume`.

## 9. Hashing, cross-page dedup, promotion

`contentHash` = tag skeleton + normalized text + background key. `structureHash` = skeleton + background + child
count + height bucket. Identical text ⇒ same `contentHash`; same layout with different copy ⇒ same `structureHash`
only. For fuzzy similarity dump 4-gram shingles of the tag skeleton — `cdp:evaluate_script {function:"() =>
window.__clone.sections.skeletons()", filePath:".clone/raw/skeletons-1440.json"}` (needs `all()` first, same page
state) — and compute Jaccard in Node from the dumps, never in-browser: it is an O(n²) cross-page comparison.

Multi-page runs (`--pages > 1`) discover routes cheapest-source-first and union the results: (1) `robots.txt`
`Sitemap:` lines via `Bash curl -s <origin>/robots.txt`, regex `^Sitemap:\s*(\S+)`; (2) `sitemap.xml` /
`sitemap_index.xml`, parsing `<loc>` and following index children (cap 5); (3) nav + footer links via the payload
below; (4) every same-origin `<a href>`, same payload, `--depth` hops; (5) `__NEXT_DATA__.buildManifest` or
`/_next/static/*/_buildManifest.js`, which reveals routes with no inbound link.

```
cdp:evaluate_script {filePath:".clone/raw/routes.json", function:
"() => { const org = location.origin, seen = new Map();
  const clean = (h) => { try { const u = new URL(h, location.href); if (u.origin !== org) return null;
    u.hash = ''; u.search = ''; return u.pathname.replace(/\\/+$/, '') || '/'; } catch (e) { return null; } };
  for (const a of document.querySelectorAll('a[href]')) { const p = clean(a.getAttribute('href')); if (!p) continue;
    const z = a.closest('header,nav') ? 'nav' : a.closest('footer') ? 'footer' : 'body';
    const r = seen.get(p) || { route: p, count: 0, zones: [], text: (a.innerText || '').trim().slice(0, 60) };

Drop `mailto:`/`tel:`/`javascript:`, non-HTML extensions, infinite spaces (`/tag/`, `/page/\d+`), and anything
`robots.txt` disallows. Rank `nav zone > footer zone > inbound count > sitemap order`, take the top `--pages N`, write
`.clone/pages.json` = `{origin, discovered, selected, depth, pages:[{id, route, url, rank, reason, state,
sectionCount, manifest}]}`. Segment **every** selected page before building **any** of them: building `home` first
and then finding that `pricing` shares four of its sections means rewriting `home`'s imports.

Promotion into the shared dir, recorded in `.clone/components.json` — same shape discipline as `pages.json`, keyed
`c_<hash>` where `<hash>` is the `contentHash` (or `structureHash` for a props-derived promotion) that grouped the
members:

```jsonc
{ "schema": "clone-site/components@1", "capturedAt": "s",
  "components": { "c_9f2c41a8": {
    "kind": "content|structure|jaccard|role",   // which row of the table below promoted it
    "sharedKey": "SiteHeader",                  // matches run.json.sections[].sharedKey
    "file": "components/shared/SiteHeader.tsx", // repo-relative, orchestrator-owned
    "pages": ["home", "pricing"],               // pageIds it appears on
    "memberSections": ["00-header", "pricing:00-header"],
    "props": [{ "name": "ctaLabel", "from": "differing text node .cta > span", "values": { "home": "Start free", "pricing": "Get started" } }],
    "similarity": 0.94                          // Jaccard, only for kind:"jaccard"
  } } }
```

| Condition | Result |
|---|---|
| identical `contentHash` on ≥2 pages | shared, no props, built once |
| `role ∈ {header, footer, sticky-cta}` anywhere | shared + layout-mounted, even at 1 occurrence |
| identical `structureHash`, differing `contentHash`, ≥2 pages | shared + props derived from the differing text nodes |
| Jaccard ≥ 0.80 across ≥3 pages | shared + props |
| same `structureHash` ≥3× **within one page** | page-local archetype component + a data array, not shared |

Everything else stays page-local. 5 pages × 8 sections typically collapses from 40 candidates to ~22 builds; that
collapse is the only reason multi-page is affordable.

## 10. How many sections, and the wave plan

Sanity bounds 6–24. Above **24** warn once — "24+ sections; consider `--sections 0-11` for the top half first" — then
proceed. Do not gate. Budgets and profiles: `references/scaling.md`.

| Wave | Who | Work |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | orchestrator only | tokens, base CSS, `@font-face`, layout shell, `_EXAMPLE`, asset mirror, empty page file |
| 1 | 2–4 agents | shared chrome: header, footer, sticky-cta, hash-deduped shared components |
| 2…n | `--max-parallel` agents (default 6, clamp `[1,10]`) | body sections in document order |
| n+1 | orchestrator | drain `requests.json`, wire the page file, build |
| n+2… | orchestrator + repair agents | verify per `references/assembly.md` |

`--section` replaces this plan with: wave 0 (orchestrator: selected assets, tokens, minimal preview shell,
`_EXAMPLE`) → wave 1 (one `clone-section` agent or one in-thread implementation) → wave 2 (orchestrator: wire,
build, scoped verification/repair). It never schedules shared chrome unless the selected root itself has that role.

Every above-the-fold section (`box.<primary>.y < 2·VH`) goes in the first body wave, so a systemic error surfaces at
wave 2 instead of wave 6. Never schedule two sections with the same `contentHash` or `structureHash` in one wave —
dedup first, then schedule. Verify each wave while the next runs: a wrong container width caught at wave 2 is one
orchestrator edit, at wave 6 it is 20 agent repairs. Write `run.json` on every section state transition.

Ownership at fan-out — one writer per path, so no locking and no merge conflicts:

| Path | Owner |
|---|---|
| tokens file (`app/globals.css`, or `styles.css` in `--static`), base CSS, layout shell, page file (`index.html` in `--static`, including its per-section `<link>` tags), config, lockfile | orchestrator |
| asset dir, `PROVENANCE.md`, `.clone/**` except the two agent files | orchestrator |
| shared components dir — **except** one file per wave-1 agent's own `spec.writeFile` | orchestrator |
| one section component file — `components/sections/<Name>.tsx`, **or `components/shared/<Name>.tsx` when the section is shared chrome** (wave 1: `role: header\|footer\|sticky-cta`, or a hash-deduped shared component — those specs' `writeFile` points into `sharedDir` by construction), or in `--static` **both** `sections/<id>.html` and `sections/<id>.css` (every rule scoped to `[data-section="<id>"]`) — plus `.clone/sections/<id>/report.md` and `requests.json` | exactly one `clone-section` agent |

The agent-facing wording of this map is in `references/agent-brief.md`; the static-mode mechanics are in
`references/stacks.md` §5.

## 11. Failure modes

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| every `box.y` = 0 | measured inside a hijacked scroll container | boxes are container-relative by design; confirm `scrollRoot` before "fixing" it |
| section shots all show the same band | `restore()` not called between sections | one `capture()` → one screenshot → one `restore()` |
| mobile manifest has different ids | you adopted the secondary width's ids | secondary widths never own ids; merge by hash into the primary skeleton |
| `docHeight` grows every pass | infinite scroll, or a marquee appending nodes | segment from one prewarmed pass, note it in `warnings[]` |
| `sumSectionH` ≪ `docHeight` | trap (b), or a section dropped by the sliver merge | run the §4 audit; check `extraSelectors[]` before re-cutting |

<!-- SPEC-GAP: raw dumps used here that §C does not enumerate — `skeletons-<w>.json`, `capture-<id>.json`,
     `section-audit-<w>.json`, `unwrap-contents.json`, `routes.json`, `restore.json` — follow §C's existing
     `raw/<pass>.json` pattern; tall-section tiles reuse §C's `orig-w<width>-tile-<NN>.webp` name inside the section
     dir. Route discovery and the §4 audit have no `scripts/*.js` file in §A, so those two one-shot payloads are
     inlined here rather than adding a script. §A says extract-sections.js "returns the section manifest" while §E.2
     says an installer returns a summary — §E wins: install returns `{ok:true,…}`, `all()` returns the manifest. -->
